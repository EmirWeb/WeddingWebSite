					<span id="Biography5" class="Biography"><h1>I walked into McDonalds for my interview and I was so nervous. Although I had my favourite sweater on, nothing was really calming me down for what was to come. I went to my seat and this girl walked over and she had really long hair. Loooooong hair. Like to the bum long. She introduced herself as Laura, one of the Shift Managers at that location, and 10 years later, we still get along as well as we did those first 5 minutes. It may have started with the fact that we both went to Mayfield for Drama, but quickly we developed a strong bond that I still cherish to this day. Whether it was me getting my first real taste of downtown by hanging out at the condo with her and Robert, introductions to martinis and new restaurants, connecting over music, countless Pride Parades or our 10 day, mostly fun-filled trip to Costa Rica (we won't discuss your horrific back seat of the cab moment), every hang out, every conversation has made me feel like I've got a friendship that'll last forever. She's been there for me through thick and thin, as have her wonderful parents, and I am beyond happy that I get to stand up there with her as one of her Bridesmen - plus I get to wear a sweet suit as well!!</h1></span>
					<span id="Biography3" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>I met Laura in 1995 on the playground at our middle school. We were enrolled in different classrooms, yet somehow, perhaps through our common love of Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann’s production of Romeo and Juliet or our unconventional style of wearing overalls, plaid shirts and platform Converse-esque shoes we became fast friends. Fortunately our styles have since matured and I am so blessed to have remained great friends with Laura over the years.  She is a true gem of a friend!  I am honored to be part of your special day with Emir!</h1></span>
					<span id="Biography4" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Well I met Laura in Grade 8 at the highschool orientation at Mayfield.  I knew then that we would be friends with our nerdy sweatshirts, aka me in my Northern Reflections and Laura in her... Mickey Mouse possibly.  I remember the first time I had to remind Laura to swallow her fries because if you got Laura laughing while she was eating fries and coke it was unpredictable to say the least.  Unpredictable was also our Thursday nights which was mostly spent in Toronto hitting this club or that and either jumping the turnstiles at the subway to make the last bus or hopping into a random limo.  Life was always unpredictable with Laura Plant especially in the Dominican Republic where we spent too many ant riddled days in a hospital where no one spoke our language.  I am so glad that Emir is taking care of my precious Laura, but don't forget if you ever need me I will be there,   PS Emir if you hurt my Laura....you know....</h1></span>
					<span id="Biography9" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Once upon a time, Adrian and Emir met while pledging a fraternity at U of T. As an undergrad, Emir was known for his long hair, shabby clothes and shirking responsibility in favour of playing epic guitar solos well into night. In a transformation fit for reality television, Emir cleaned himself up by cutting his hair, buying some new clothes and focusing on school and work. When the lovely and enchanting Laura entered Emir's life, his fairy tale transformation from awkward caterpillar to beautiful butterfly was complete. Adrian is honoured to be a part of of Laura & Emir's wedding, which marks the happy end of one story and the first chapter of another. Congrats!</h1></span>
					<span id="Biography2" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Grade 10.  A wonderful mutual friend: April Chapman.  April and I were in history class together, and we both loved Jewel -  that was pretty much all you needed to find a bosom  friend in those days...or in the very least, be invited  to her cool Hallowe'en party.<br>  
<br>
Riding in the back of my father's pick-up truck, nervously approaching  what would have been my first high school party.  I was a country girl, and this was a city party - the kind of thing I needed my grade-school best pal, Mel Hanisch to walk beside me through, just in case everyone there was too cool to even consider talking to me.  The most dreaded moment by far was walking through the door, where potentially everyone in the room was going to look up from what they were doing to see who the latest arrival to the party was...and of course I was beyond fashionably late - this was not looking very promising.<br>
<br>
We enter.   Thankfully we do so almost completely unnoticed, except of course by our gracious host.  But what is that chaos happening in the corner?!  Some poor, awkward, gangly girl curled up in a ball with legs and arms flailing as she is being attacked by a crowd of silly-string projectiles; I remember it like it were yesterday.  What a sight!  She had to be the dorkiest, most awkward person at the party....and I knew immediately that she and I would get along juuuuust fine :).  Her name - Laura Plant.  The rest of that evening sealed the deal, with good ole' fashion clapping games and a session of voice-straining Jewel sing-a-long.  This was destiny.<br>
<br>
By late grade 11, I had my driver's license and my own car.  Laura in tow, we were thirsty for adventure!  Flipping coins to decide the direction, we would end up in the most fantastical places.  One fine day, the coins brought us upon a waterfall.  Healthy appetites and picnic in hand,  Laura selects the perfect picnic table as close to the fall as she could find - after all, we wanted the best view!  But my country-girl attitude of freedom told me "nahh, we can do better".   There was this PERFECT rock smack dab in the middle of the river at the very top of the falls...and THAT was where I wanted to eat lunch.  When I reveal my plan to Laura, she looks at me and says "but our shoes are going to get wet trying to get there"!  I question my new pal's common sense and blurted "take your shoes off"!  At the suggestion, Laura looks at me as though I was the most alien person she had ever met!  "T..T...Take my shoes off"?!!  "Umm...yes, dear Laura".  She told me she hadn't taken her shoes off to walk around barefoot outside before - and I had never met such a soul in all my sheltered country-girl life.   We completely shocked each other!<br>  
<br>
And so our exploring together grew to be more frequent and more adventurous as time went on.  Our bond grew deeper as we realized that we had a lot to learn from each other.  Laura went barefoot that day.  I think if you ask her, she might say this was one of those keystone moments in her life.  At the time, she called my influences "corruption", (and I am sure my parents considered her city-girl influences upon me the same) - but Laura has not been the same person since, seeking adventure in all sorts of wild and natural places, surpassing even my level of comfort at times!  And thanks to Laura, this country girl has come to be quite comfortable to navigate the streets of many-a-large city, exploring cultural wonders and chic boutiques, with an ease that was definitely not from the nurture of my up-bringing.

					<span id="Biography8" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Emir (insert myriad nicknames) and I became friends in our early days at the University of Toronto meeting  through our mutual association with the Fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta (FIJI). Living together in the Chapter house on Madison Avenue we shared many hilarious and noteworthy experiences which will likely be related at his expense at some point during the wedding festivities. Emir has always been a great brother and true friend, it will be a pleasure to stand by his side on this special day.<br> 
<br>
Laura is a very special lady. We were all very pleased when Emir met her, as prior to this both his sexuality and the prospect of a happy and successful future remained ambiguous. In all seriousness, the two of them were obviously meant for one another and over the years this has only become more evident. I was there when they made the first steps to move in together, eventually becoming engaged, and now sharing their first home. Having successfully survived the experimental trial of puppy raising I have a feeling a baby boy will be joining their household in the coming year. I could not be happier for them and to be a part of their lives and this wedding celebration. </h1></span>
					<span id="Biography0" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Emir first met me when he was a little bit less than 5 years old. For the next 13 or so years we were inseparable. Mainly because we shared a bedroom. He was always taller than me but that changed not too long ago. I take much pride in that now.<br>
<br>
Growing up, playing basketball and video games was fun. He would always get the good controller, the good side of the keyboard, the car in Monopoly, and godamn Mario (leaving me with Luigi). He would bulldoze me in basketball and then have the audacity to call a defensive foul. It was pretty much a very regular younger brother older brother dynamic.<br>
<br>
But he did teach me to program, and he also bought me my first non-plastic rollerblades. I also remember him sprinting after a few kids that were picking on me when we first moved to Toronto. I didn't forgot those things Emir. I'm not a man of many word, sooooooo Love you. XOXOXOX</h1></span>
					<span id="Biography6" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>Years ago, and infant so<br>
My mother held me down below<br>
To a youngster she did show<br>
A canvas blank, a Plant to grow<br>
<br>
Off to the school, to show and tell<br>
Where little ones, learn to spell<br>
The youngster held me, till the bell<br>
And proudly wished her sister well<br>
<br>
As years went on the youngster grew<br>
Her tiny Plant began to bloom<br>
She taught me much, and all she knew<br>
And mothered me as sisters do<br>
<br>
She dressed me up, and spun me ‘round<br>
Like figure skaters, but carpet bound<br>
And if I toppled to the ground<br>
Two loving hands would soon surround<br>
<br>
Next a lunch, thank you and please<br>
Her favourite thing to hate: grilled cheese<br>
Or Hamburger Helper! Or Ricearonie!<br> 
These were Lauras specialties.<br> 
<br>
But as I grew, she grew beyond<br>
And explored the world outside our lawn<br>
At dusk the city, and home by dawn<br>
She often left, but never gone<br>
<br>
A while more, her condo years<br>
With morning teas and evening beers<br>
Strings and songs and paintbrush smears<br>
We’d fall asleep as morning nears<br>
<br>
Hard at work, but loves to play<br>
Thanks for editing all my resumes!<br>
And making sure that I’m okay<br>
And always knowing what to say<br>
<br>
A wedding gown, and corral tie<br>
I cannot promise that I won’t cry<br>
The world approaches this wife to be<br>
And no matter what she’ll always have me</h1></span>
				<span id="Biography1" class="Biography Hidden"><h1>I don't remember when exactly Laura and I met, though I know it was around the time I turned 15 and it was at Wal-Mart McDonald's in Brampton. I'd just gotten a job there, and Laura was a manager. I quickly (almost effortlessly) became one of her favourites, but it wasn't until I was promoted to management that the fun really began. From making scripted announcements about "Manager's Specials" over Wal-Mart's PA system, tag-teaming busy holiday Saturdays and taking on special projects to make our store better, we were always on the same wavelength when it came to work. Outside of work, we became friends, with Laura introducing me to a lot of "firsts" throughout my formative teenage years.<br>
<br>
I went away to school, and then moved to China, but a chance encounter with Laura on Bloor Street upon my return set the rest of my life in motion. We hadn't seen each other in years, but her company was hiring, and I needed a job. And so we started working together for the second time, and our friendship outside of work flourished.<br>
<br>
Fast forward a couple years: Laura and I work together again, this time as partners. Our relationship has many layers, and is made up of a wonderful and unique blend of professional and personal. There's always so much to talk about. I couldn't be more excited to be part of Laura and Emir's special day. They're wonderful together, and perfect for each other. Here's to a lifetime of memories - those we've created over the past 11 years, and those that we'll share in the future! </h1></span>
