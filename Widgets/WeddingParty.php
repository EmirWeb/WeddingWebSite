For the next 13 or so years we were inseparable. Mainly because we shared a bedroom. He was always taller than me but that changed not too long ago. I take much pride in
				that now. Growing up, playing basketball and video games was fun. He would always get the good controller, the good side of the keyboard, the car in Monopoly, and godamn Mario (leaving me with Luigi). He would bulldoze me in basketball and then have the audacity to call a defensive foul. It was
				pretty much a very regular younger brother older brother dynamic. But he did teach me to program, and he also bought me my first non-plastic rollerblades. I also remember him sprinting after a few kids that were picking on me when we first moved to Toronto. I didn't forgot those things Emir. I'm
				not a man of many words, sooooooo Love you. XOXOXOX</span>

I went to my seat and this girl walked over and she had really long hair. Loooooong hair. Like to the bum long. She introduced herself as Laura, one of the Shift Managers, and
				10 years later we still get along as well as we did those first 5 minutes. It may have started with the fact that we both went to Mayfield for Drama, but quickly we developed a strong bond that I still cherish to this day. Whether it was me getting my first real taste of downtown by hanging out
				at the condo with her and Robert, introductions to martinis and new restaurants, connecting over music, countless Pride Parades or our 10 day, mostly fun-filled trip to Costa Rica, every hang out, every conversation has made me feel like I've got a friendship that'll last forever. She's been
				there for me through thick and thin, as have her wonderful parents, and I am beyond happy that I get to stand up there with her as her Bridesman - plus I get to wear a sweet suit as well!</span>

I'd just gotten a job there, and Laura was a manager. I quickly (almost effortlessly) became one of her favourites, but it wasn't until I was promoted to management that the
				fun really began. From making scripted announcements about "Manager's Specials" over Wal-Mart's PA system, tag-teaming busy Saturdays and taking on special projects to make our store better, we were always on the same wavelength when it came to work. Outside of work, we became friends, with
				Laura introducing me to a lot of "firsts" throughout my formative teenage years. I went away to school, and then moved to China, but a chance encounter with Laura on Bloor Street upon my return set the rest of my life in motion. We hadn't seen each other in years, but her company was hiring, and
				I needed a job. We started working together for the second time, and our friendship outside of work flourished. Laura and I work together again, this time as partners. Our relationship has many layers, and is made up of a wonderful and unique blend of professional and personal. There's always so
				much to talk about. I couldn't be more excited to be part of Laura and Emir's special day. They're wonderful together, and perfect for each other.</span>

I knew then that we would be friends with our nerdy sweatshirts, me in my Northern Reflections and Laura in her... Mickey Mouse possibly. I remember the first time I had to remind Laura
				to swallow her fries because if you got Laura laughing while she was eating fries and coke it was unpredictable, to say the least. Unpredictable was also our Thursday girls night outs, which were mostly spent in Toronto "hitting the clubs", jumping the turnstiles at the subway to make the last
				train or hopping into a random limo. Life was always unpredictable with Laura Plant. I am so glad that Emir is taking care of my precious Laura, but don't forget Emir, if you ever need me I will be there. PS, Emir if you hurt my Laura....you know....</span>

To a youngster she did show, a canvas blank, a Plant to grow. Off to the school, to show and tell, where little ones, learn to spell. The youngster held me, till the bell, and
				proudly wished her sister well. As years went on, the youngster grew, her tiny Plant began to bloom. She taught me much, and all she knew, and mothered me as sisters do. She dressed me up, and spun me ‘round, like figure skaters, but carpet bound. And if I toppled to the ground, two loving hands
				would soon surround. Next a lunch, thank you and please, her favourite thing to hate: grilled cheese. Or Hamburger Helper! Or Ricearonie! These were Laura's specialities. But as I grew, she grew beyond, and explored the world outside our lawn. At dusk the city, and home by dawn, she often left,
				but never gone. A while more, her condo years, with morning teas and evening beers. Strings and songs and paintbrush smears, we’d fall asleep as morning nears. Hard at work, but loves to play, thanks for editing all my resumes! And making sure that I’m okay, and always knowing what to say. A
				wedding gown, and corral tie, I cannot promise that I won’t cry. The world approaches, this wife to be, and no matter what she’ll always have me </span>

We both loved Jewel - that was pretty much all you needed to find a bosom friend in those days, or in the very least, be invited to her cool Hallowe'en party. Riding in
				the back of my father's pick-up truck, I nervously approached my first high school party. I was a country girl, and this was a city party - the kind of thing I needed my grade-school best pal, Mel Hanisch to walk beside me through, just in case everyone there was too cool to even consider
				talking to me. The most dreaded moment by far was walking through the door, where potentially everyone in the room was going to look up from what they were doing to see who the latest arrival to the party was...and of course I was beyond fashionably late. Thankfully we entered almost completely
				unnoticed, except of course by our gracious host. But what was that chaos happening in the corner?! Some poor, awkward, girl curled up in a ball with legs and arms flailing as she is being attacked by a crowd of silly-string projectiles; I remember it like it were yesterday. What a sight! She
				had to be the dorkiest, most awkward person at the party....and I knew immediately that she and I would get along juuuuust fine. The rest of that evening sealed the deal, with good ole' fashion clapping games and a session of voice-straining Jewel sing-a-long. It was destiny. </span>
