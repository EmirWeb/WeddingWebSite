<h1>Laura and Emir met in May of 2007 while working together at Alice Fazooli's.  Although they were just friends, Laura remembers the first time she saw Emir, weaving through the booths with his head cocked to the side and arms full of dishes. He was a hard worker with a lot of integrity.  Emir remembers noticing Laura’s red lips and long hair. They worked side by side, on and off, for years without realizing they were meant to be together.</h1>

<h1>Laura remembered that Emir loves heavy metal. Excited about spreading the good word about the amazing Mercy Now, she invited him to a show... as friends.  Emir didn’t realize that until he arrived and noticed she also invited her siblings and a few other friends.</h1>

<h1>A week later Emir thought for sure it was a date when she invited him to see Hot Wax at the Dakota Tavern, until he saw Katie and Adam and more than a few friends were there again...  Even though Laura was oblivious to any of Emir’s true intentions, this did not stop him from telling her “I think you are beautiful”.  </h1>

<h1>But it wasn’t until one night in particular...  Emir took Laura to the Tim Burton Exhibit at TIFF followed by dinner at Hey Lucy.  Everything fell into place and they have been inseparable since.

<h1>Emir had one last ‘test’ to pass.  After taking her Personality Assessment, she was at first surprised about what she read!  They were more similar than they thought, both high in Extraversion and Dominance and low in Conformity and Patience!  But over the following months, as they got to know each other better, they saw each other’s true colours and fell madly in love.</h1>
