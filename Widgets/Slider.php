					scratch, she rejigged a poem Laura had written years earlier about her need to explore the world and all it’s possibilities. They recorded it with their good friend Peter Iskandar, who also mastered it. It was one of the most beautiful gifts Laura has received and brought on more than a few
					tears (or SOBS) of joy! This, along with her parents flying into Toronto for another birthday surprise, made for a very special event.</span>
