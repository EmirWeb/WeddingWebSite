					hair. They worked side by side, on and off for years, without realizing they were meant to be together.</h1>

They were more similar than they thought, both high in Extraversion and Dominance and low
					in Conformity and Patience! But over the following months, as they got to know each other better, they saw each other’s true colours and fell madly in love.</h1>

				<h1>For Laura’s 29th Birthday, Emir wrote her a song. After crafting the melody, he had Laura’s dear friend Deanna write the lyrics and sing them. But instead of writing them from scratch, she rejigged a poem Laura had written years earlier about her need to explore the world and all it’s
					possibilities. They recorded it with their good friend Peter Iskandar, who also mastered it. It was one of the most beautiful gifts Laura has received and brought on more than a few tears (or SOBS) of joy! This, along with her parents flying into Toronto for another birthday surprise, made for
					a very special event.</h1>
