					with his head cocked to the side and arms full of dishes. Emir remembers noticing Laura’s red lips and long hair. They worked side by side, on and off for years, without realizing they were meant to be together.</span>

					insight into Emir. They were more similar than they thought, both high in Extraversion and Dominance and low in Conformity and Patience! But over the following months, as they got to know each other better, they saw each other’s true colours and fell madly in love.</span>

					scratch, she rejigged a poem Laura had written years earlier about her need to explore the world and all it’s possibilities. They recorded it with their good friend Peter Iskandar, who also mastered it. It was one of the most beautiful gifts Laura has received and brought on more than a few
					tears (or SOBS) of joy! This, along with her parents flying into Toronto for another birthday surprise, made for a very special event.</span>
